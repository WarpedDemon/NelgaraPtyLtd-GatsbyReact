Through using strategic procurement\n                strategies I managed to procure circa $45,000,000 worth\n                of trades and raise the margin to 4.5% and created a\n                1.5% trade contingency for the project.\n            <br><br>\n            •\tMajor Infrastructure Project: I was tasked with the\n                procurement of a mechanical services (HVAC) package, the\n                initial Tender submissions were well in excess of target\n                budget. By developing a procurement strategy and working\n                with all key stakeholders to value manage the design the\n                net result was an overall saving of $10m on the initial\n                Tender pricing.\n            <br><br>\n            •\tMajor Resource Project: In February 2009 major flooding\n                of the MESA A in the Western Australis North West project\n                occurred.
