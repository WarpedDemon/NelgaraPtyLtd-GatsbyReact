    Accessibility
    -------------
    1) Updated Navbar, Hamburger, Footer and other various component buttons to adhere to react
       accessibility standards. I.E - Making sure they have aria labels if they
       don't have a text label, and ensuring they have onKeyDown events as opposed
       to just click events.
    2) Fix out of order / skipped levels of header tags.

    Unfortunately I couldn't make any revisions to improve this score.
